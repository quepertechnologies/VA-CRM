156k roughly accounts to 2.5 FT roles and 65k is the salary he draws as a FT so holistically it looks like there is 4 FT Roles with the organization

We need a proper business plan that explains how a FT role (Sukhi ) will help the business get more contracts and savings in terms of less reliance on the Sub contractor

Additionally please insert all the available BAS as the company is moving towards profit as per Paramveer

My concern is the company is leather good company and Upholsterer is more to do with furniture. However he confirms the skill set required is that of a Upholsterer

He has a skill assessment as a Cook 

His inquiry is if he can do a skill assessment as a Chef

I have advised him that we will need to extract his information provided on the SC 400 and SC 482 Visa and act accordingly. If previous information are provided as a Cook it is pointless doing a new assessment as a Chef 

He has applied as a single applicant and has past relationship issues and this needs to  discussed with me (Sudin)

He is looking for a possible SC 491 NSW Pathway 1 as well. He is living in Hornsby but working in regional place. If this is to go ahead we will need to request RDA 1st before applying and then put the application 



His girlfriend in on a student visa and currently studying at Torrens (Bach in Comm Service) . His girlfriend doesnt like the course and feels it is very expensive too. I have advised to change to Bach of Early Childhood at IKON Sept 2024 Intake 



Action Plan 

Follow Up for SC 491 Visa with Dipesh and check if he wants to proceed forward

Pramveer explained that Amarok Construction only does carpentry jobs such as doors, windows and anything to do with woods

The 156k annual subcontractor expenses are all carpenters and joiners 

156k roughly accounts to 2.5 FT roles and 65k is the salary he draws as a FT so holistically it looks like there is 4 FT Roles with the organization 

We need a proper business plan that explains how a FT role (Sukhi ) will help the business get more contracts and savings in terms of less reliance on the Sub contractor 

Additionally please insert all the available BAS as the company is moving towards profit as per Paramveer 

I have explained the prospect of success is 50-50% given the business is on loss and the size of the turnover however Paramveer has asked us to proceed with the Nomination

In his Bachelors he has taken 1 year exemptions so 4 Years AQF Level 7 or higher study may be an issue while meeting the language requirement with AITSL

My argument is that client has done a 3 Years course within which 1 Year was exempted hence it should still qualify as 3 Years Study

Once he completes his Grad Dip please arrange for skill assessment in case 4 years study is not recognised we will do 1 Year of Master of Education

I have informed him about this

I have also asked him to keep looking for job in IT. He has completed his PYP and we will need to apply for skill assessment too

I have advised him to do Grad Dip of EC at SCU  (Online)

In his Bachelors he has taken 1 year exemptions so 4 Years AQF Level 7 or higher study may be an issue while meeting the language requirement with AITSL

My argument is that client has done a 3 Years course within which 1 Year was exempted hence it should still qualify as 3 Years  Study

Once he completes his Grad Dip please arrange for skill assessment in case 4 years study is not recognised we will do 1 Year of Master of Education 

I have informed him about this

I have also asked him to keep looking for job in IT. He has completed his PYP and we will need to apply for skill assessment too

Suraj was in Australia earlier on a student visa  Bach in Commerce(Accounting) in ACU 

2014

He completed his course and returned to Nepal

Married Lilisha Malla on 02/2019 in Australia

Hasn't notified the Department

Left Australia in 10/2019

Have met in Singapore 07/2022 

Lilisha hasn't visited Nepal since her marriage due to her study and work however the couple have been in touch with one another through WhatsApp, Messenger, and Normal Phone 

They were in live-in relationship before the marriage for almost 3 years(From 2016)

Parents are aware of the relationship but not marriage 

Lilisha Mom  is in Korea and Dad is in Portugal so Suraj is unbale to meet them while he has been in Nepal 

Suraj has a previous TR Refusal as he failed to provide the AFP

He was on AAT and in between left for Nepal 

He has informed me that in the student visa for Lilisha, they have mentioned Suraj as a non-accompanying dependent

Couple talk to each other mote than 5 times a day on a daily basis 

They spend 9 days together in Singapore 



Action Plan :

I have asked Suraj to take another appointment with Lilisha to discuss further the TR application

My concern is that the applicant has been living apart for 3 years and 4 months and have met only once for 9 days.
